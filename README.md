Bachelor Thesis "Player Training and Guidance in 3D First Person Character Action Games"

ABSTRACT
In order to establish more know-how in the field of practical tutorial design in 3D first person character action games, this bachelor thesis explores the backgrounds of learning psychology in games and how video games should teach their players regardless of background according to researchers like James Paul Gee and Matthew White. To create a connection between theory and practical work, two versions of a prototype game tutorial differing in their teaching methods are introduced. Test groups played each version before reporting on their encounter in a statistical poll. The play metrics and poll data were compared and analysed with the following central results: Inexperienced gamers suffered from the self-contained exploration-encouraging approach taken in the version focused on indirect player guidance, as they missed clear, direct instructions. On the other hand, very experienced players enjoyed that version more because it didnâ€Ÿt force them to relearn abilities they already possessed. Finally this bachelor thesis lists various improvements to the prototype version in order to enhance the overall learning effect of players.
